# This program is created for Image Processing given by Professor Mariofanna.

# main() function contains in Mainpanel.java
# The program can calculate the Fourier coefficients for a given image using the naive algorithm, but the spectrum could not be printed out.

# The TestDemo.java contains another main function for the Demopanel which shows the rotation movements of three balls with different colors. This is designed for showing how a complex frequency is formed. But this is still under construction.

# The sobel filter works, but only executes the x-direction derivation. I am still working on this one.
